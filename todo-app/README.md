# Todo App

A simple Todo List app built with React. This application allows you to add, complete, delete, and filter your todos. It also uses the browser's `localStorage` to save your todos, so you won't lose them even if you refresh the page.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new todos.
- **Complete Todo**: Users can mark a todo as completed.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove a todo from the list.
- **Filter Todos**: Users can filter todos by their completion status (All, Completed, or Incomplete).
- **Persist Todos**: Todos are saved in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, so data persists between page reloads.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: The app is built using React for managing UI components and state.
- **localStorage**: Uses the browser's `localStorage` to persist todos between page reloads.
